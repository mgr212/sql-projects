What were my objecives?
  Find out how many fires there were in a 5 year range
  Get distinct values for everything relevant( fire types, engines, neighborhoods)
  How many fires and what type
  What type occured the most
  How many differnt unites responding
  How many neighbohoods
  Where did most of the fires occur
  Query days and mothns to see if there are any corralations

Found the total with a SUM function and sub query

Find and count the distinct fire types 

SELECT type_description, incident_type

UNION DISTINCT
SELECT type_description, incident_type
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire18`

UNION DISTINCT
SELECT type_description, incident_type
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire21`
ORDER BY incident_type ASC;

Get a count of each iniduvidual fire type foe each year

SELECT COUNT(type_description), type_description
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire17`
GROUP BY type_description
ORDER BY type_description
(did this 5x for each year and put into excel sheet)

Find and count the distinct neighborhods

Incident per neighborhhod by year
      
SELECT COUNT(incident_type) AS incident, neighborhood
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire17`
GROUP BY neighborhood
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(incident_type) AS incident, neighborhood

GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY neighborhood;
(first issue i ran into, i coundt get indiviual rows for year or neighborhood each trying different queries. I then added a new table just to get the indiviual neighborhod count for each neighbohood)

New table, was able to get the incidnet count for each neighborhood
SELECT COUNT(neighborhood) AS incident, neighborhood
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY incident DESC;
(Wilkinsburgh had the most)

Indiviudal year for neighborhoods
SELECT COUNT(neighborhood) AS incident, neighborhood
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
WHERE date_15 = 2017
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY incident DESC;
(did 5x for each year)

Get a engine and truck count

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT primary_unit), primary_unit
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY primary_unit;

Number of incedents for each indiviual unit

SELECT COUNT(primary_unit) AS incidents, primary_unit
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY primary_unit
ORDER by incidents DESC;
(16 engine had the most, stationed in Wilkinsburg)

Percentage of incidents per neighborhoods 

SELECT type_description, COUNT(type_description) AS incidents, 
ROUND(COUNT(neighborhood) / (SELECT COUNT(call_no) 
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY type_description
ORDER by incidents DESC;

Percentage of incidents per unit

SELECT primary_unit, COUNT(primary_unit) AS incidents, 
ROUND(COUNT(primary_unit) / (SELECT COUNT(call_no)

FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY primary_unit
ORDER by incidents DESC;

Percentage of fire types

SELECT type_description, COUNT(type_description) AS incidents,

FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY type_description
ORDER by incidents DESC;

Last, montha and day count

Month
SELECT COUNT(month) AS incidents, month
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY month
ORDER by incidents DESC;


SELECT month, COUNT(month) AS incidents, 
ROUND(COUNT(neighborhood) / (SELECT COUNT(call_no) 
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM `fire-pitt-2022.Pitt_Fire.fire_all`
GROUP BY month
