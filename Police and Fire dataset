What were my objecives?
  Create a simple data base to join tables
  Compare the incdent count betwen fire and police
  Compare the incidnet count of the neighborhoods
  Filter the data by year and neighborhhod for a deeper look
  
  Intial join query
SELECT offenses, incident_type
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire`, `pitt-374613.EMS.police`
WHERE `pitt-374613.EMS.fire`.neighborhood =`pitt-374613.EMS.police`. neighborhood
(i didnt use a join statement becasue i was troublshooting trying to get the schema correct for querries

Coount of incidents for each table

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.pk) AS police, COUNT(DISTINCT f.call_no) AS fire
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire` AS f 
JOIN `pitt-374613.EMS.police` AS p 
ON f.police_zone = p.police_zone;

Sticking with 'police_zone', filtered results by indiviual zone

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.pk) AS police, COUNT(DISTINCT f.call_no) AS fire
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire` AS f 
JOIN `pitt-374613.EMS.police` AS p 
ON f.police_zone = p.police_zone
WHERE f.police_zone = 1; 
(seven total zones total zones)

Next, incidents per neigberhood

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.pk) AS police, COUNT(DISTINCT f.call_no) AS fire, p.neighborhood
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire` ASf
JOIN `pitt-374613.EMS.police` AS p 
ON f.neighborhood = p.neighborhood 
GROUP BY p.neighborhood
ORDER BY police DESC, fire DESC;

Filtered these results by year

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.pk) AS police, COUNT(DISTINCT f.call_no) AS fire,
p.neighborhood,
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire` AS f 
INNER JOIN `pitt-374613.EMS.police` AS p 
ON f.neighborhood = p.neighborhood
WHERE f.year = 2016
GROUP BY p.neighborhood;
(did this a few more times with different years)

Did a count by just the year

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.pk) as police, COUNT(DISTINCT f.call_no) as fire
FROM `pitt-374613.EMS.fire` AS f 
JOIN `pitt-374613.EMS.police` AS p 
ON f.year = p.year
WHERE f.year = 2016;
(did this a few more times with different years)

I feel other factors would be needed to find correlations, mainly the medical emergencies that fire also goes on along with paramedics to show any correlatons or trends
or anything that might be unusal. 

Next, quereries to prepare for a future viusalization project

Over percentage of percentage by neighborhood

Top 10 ten neighborhoods with police incidents

SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, neighborhood
FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

By year

SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, neighborhood
FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

By police zone

SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, police_zone
FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
GROUP BY police_zone
ORDER BY total DESC

Zone by year

SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, police_zone
FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY police_zone
ORDER BY total DESC;

Next break it down into the percentage of calls by neighbohood

WITH counts AS
  (SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, neighborhood
  FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
  GROUP BY neighborhood)
SELECT neighborhood, total, (total / (SELECT SUM(total) FROM counts)) * 100 AS percentage
FROM counts
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

BY police zone 

WITH counts AS
  (SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, police_zone
  FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
  GROUP BY police_zone)
SELECT police_zone, total, (total / (SELECT SUM(total) FROM counts)) * 100 AS percentage
FROM counts
ORDER BY total DESC;

Last, by year

WITH counts AS
  (SELECT COUNT(pk) AS total, year
  FROM pitt-374613.EMS.police
  GROUP BY year)
SELECT year, total, (total / (SELECT SUM(total) FROM counts)) * 100 AS percentage
FROM counts
ORDER BY total DESC;
